        <h1>Our Menu</h1>
        <h2>Falafel <span>NEW</span></h2>
        <p>In the darkness of your eyes, I'm lost in desire's sweet fire,
            Where every whispered promise is a silken thread that binds me tight.
            Your touch is the spark that sets my soul aflame, a burning passion that never tires.
            In the secret chambers of your heart, I find the map to our forbidden delight,
            With every kiss, I'm ravished by the hunger that devours my soul, a craving that only your love can make right.
            In your embrace, I'm surrendered to the rhythm of our entwined bodies, a symphony of love
            that echoes through the night."</p>
